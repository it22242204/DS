## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install Docker**: Install Docker and Docker Compose from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
3. **Install MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or accessible via a cloud provider.

### Backend Deployment

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file in each service directory (e.g., `user_service`, `delivery_service`, etc.) to `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` files with the appropriate values (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

3. **Start backend services using Docker Compose**:
   - For all services:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - Alternatively, start individual services by navigating to their respective directories and running:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

4. **Verify backend services**:
   - Check the logs to ensure all services are running without errors.
   - Access the services via their respective ports (e.g., `http://localhost:5200` for the delivery service).

### Frontend Deployment

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
   - Update the `.env` file with the appropriate values (e.g., API base URLs).

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the terminal).

---

### Database Setup

1. **Ensure MongoDB is running**:
   - If using a local MongoDB instance, ensure it is running on the default port (`27017`).
   - If using a cloud MongoDB instance, ensure the connection string is correctly configured in the `.env` files.

2. **Seed the database (if required)**:
   - Run any database seeding scripts provided in the backend services.

---

### Gateway Setup (Optional)

1. **Navigate to the gateway directory**:
   ```sh
   cd backend/gateway
   ```

2. **Start the gateway**:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   - The gateway will proxy requests to the appropriate backend services.

---

### Testing the System

1. **Access the frontend**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. **Test API endpoints**:
   - Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the backend APIs.

3. **Verify integration**:
   - Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend services correctly.

---

### Deployment to Production

1. **Build the frontend**:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy backend and frontend**:
   - Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel) to deploy the services.
   - Ensure environment variables are configured correctly in the production environment.

3. **Set up a reverse proxy**:
   - Use Nginx or Apache to route requests to the appropriate services.

4. **Monitor the system**:
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system performance and logs.

### Notes
- Ensure all `.env` files are kept secure and not committed to version control.
- Update the ports and URLs in the instructions if they differ in your setup.
